Steps taken to design this project:
1- Explore Data: 
The first step in any machine learning project is to explore the data that you will use to train a model. The goal of this exploration is to try to understand the relationships between its attributes; in particular, any apparent correlation between the features and the label your model will try to predict. This may require some work to detect and fix issues in the data (such as dealing with missing values, errors, or outlier values), deriving new feature columns by transforming or combining existing features (a process known as feature engineering), normalizing numeric features (values you can measure or count) so they're on a similar scale, and encoding categorical features (values that represent discrete categories) as numeric indicators.

2- Supervised machine learning: Classification algorithms in supervised learning predict to which category, or class, an observation belongs.
Supervised machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of features and predict a label using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. The training process fits the features to the known labels to define a general function that can be applied to new features for which the labels are unknown, and predict them. 
The main features include:

* Object-oriented design in JavaScript
* Frontend design using JavaScript Canvas and Context

## Future Improvements

### Efficiency and AI Power
There are several ways that the AI and algorithms of the game could be improved in the future. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Experiment with deeper neural network architectures:** Explore adding more hidden layers to your neural network to increase its capacity for learning and decision-making. Deeper architectures can potentially capture more complex patterns and relationships within the input data.

- **Implement advanced activation functions:**  Investigate alternative activation functions such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or Leaky ReLU, which can enhance the network's ability to model non-linear relationships in the data.

- **Regularization techniques:** Incorporate regularization techniques like dropout or L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capabilities of your neural network.

- **Data augmentation:** Augment your training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or adding noise. This technique can help increase the diversity of the training set, improving the model's robustness and performance.

- **Early stopping:** Implement early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting and find the best iteration where the model generalizes well on unseen data.
