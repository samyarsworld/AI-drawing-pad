## About
The steps taken to design this project:

It's common practice to train the model using a subset of the data, while holding back some data with which to test the trained model. This enables us to compare the labels that the model predicts with the actual known labels in the original dataset. 

1- Explore Data: 
The first step in any machine learning project is to explore the data that you will use to train a model. The goal of this exploration is to try to understand the relationships between its attributes; in particular, any apparent correlation between the features and the label your model will try to predict. This may require some work to detect and fix issues in the data (such as dealing with missing values, errors, or outlier values), deriving new feature columns by transforming or combining existing features (a process known as feature engineering), normalizing numeric features (values you can measure or count) so they're on a similar scale, and encoding categorical features (values that represent discrete categories) as numeric indicators.

We could train a model using all of the data, but it's common practice in supervised learning to split the data into two subsets; a (typically larger) set with which to train the model, and a smaller "hold-back" set with which to validate the trained model. This enables us to evaluate how well the model performs when used with the validation dataset by comparing the predicted labels to the known labels.

2- Preprocessing data: Scaling

3- Normalizing
4- Supervised machine learning: Classification algorithms in supervised learning predict to which category, or class, an observation belongs.
Supervised machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of features and predict a label using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. The training process fits the features to the known labels to define a general function that can be applied to new features for which the labels are unknown and predict them. 

5- Confusion Matrix

The main features include:

* Object-oriented design in JavaScript
* Frontend design using JavaScript Canvas and Context
* (More to be added)

## Developer Features
Here are some technical considerations that were used to build and design this project:

**:**

**Visuals and frontend:** JavaScript in conjunction with HTML is used to bring visuals to the browser. More specifically, the canvas element is used from HTML and manipulated by JavaScript to create a dynamic environment.
